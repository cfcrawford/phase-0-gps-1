###GPS 1 Reflection###
**What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**

I still was in the process of understanding the push process, which commands to use and how to merge the origin and master.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**

This push process was clarified to me a little bit better by my pair partner. My pair and I also firgured out how to merge a master and branch locally.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**

I had questions about relative paths and how they worked inline. My pair and I also ran into a question in GitHub about how collaborators see a repository they were added to, which we eventually figured out.

**What still confuses you about git?**

The thing that still confuses me about git is how to troubleshoot and fix any errors in the terminal. So far I've been able to follow the git workflow with success, but if I make an error such as not creating a new branch or creating too many branches, it takes me a while to figure it out.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**

My first experience was positive, aside from me feeling a bit nervous at first. Our guide was very in helpful in facilitating the structure of the session and answering our questions, but mostly stayed in the background and observed us working. My pair partner was also very cooperative and I felt our communication was good enough to get us through a few minor glitches that we encountered.
