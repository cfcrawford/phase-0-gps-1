### What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS?
Prior to the GPS, I was struggling with the concept of HEAD and the use of the git log to jump back to certain stages of work using the log id. This did not come up in the GPS though, and I will do some additional reading and practice to solidify the concept.

### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
1. The concept of why we always git pull origin master at the start of our workflow
2. The concept of collaborating on repos
3. Further clarification of the navigator and driver roles
4. The idea of merge conflicts and hot to investigate and resolve them

### What questions did you ask the pair and the guide?
1. I asked the guide about the github message windows that we always seem to leave blank during the pull workflow, and about the dangers of a repo inside a repo
2. I asked my pair about local git merges, and about some of the commands on a Mac (I use windows) 

### What still confuses you about git?
It was good to have a more realistic git workflow experience as so far we have been requesting and reviewing our own pull requests. I was a little confused about the github repo that is set to "collaborate" with others. It didn't show up for me at first, and it was ahead of my local master even after I pulled it down. The issue seemed to resolve itself after I searched for the repo on Github and cloned it again.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a pleasant experience. My pair and I got along well and were respectful and friendly as we took on the challenge. I felt we were comfortable asking each other questions and interrupting each other if we didn't understand or wanted to go back. The guide was great and she helped explain a couple of concepts (like the roles of a driver and navigator), as well as guided us away from going down the wrong path a couple of times.

My partner and I made a couple of mistakes along the way but we talked about it, tried a few different iedas and came up with a solution, and walked away with a deeper understanding each time. I look forward to pairing with her again.
